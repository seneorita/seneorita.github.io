<h1>Your body type is: <span style="color:darkblue"> Hourglass </span></h1>

<p class="mid-p11"> The key to dressing an Hourglass body type is to proportionally dress the top and bottom of your body while accentuating your waist.
	Wide belts over shirts and dresses are a great way to show off your waist.
	You can create an even more curvaceous effect by proportionally adding a bit of volume to your upper and lower body,
	but always try to maintain balance since it is your best asset.
	You have great legs so feel free to play with skirt lengths. </p>
