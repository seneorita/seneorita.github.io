	There is nothing you can do about the fact that people will judge you by the way you look,
	so use it to your advantage. You don't have to drain your bank account to look refined.
	You just have to be wise with your choices.

	<i><span style="color:#26734d">Here are a few tips on refining the way you look:</span></i>
	<ul>
	<li><mark>Posture:</mark> Stand up straight and hold your head up when you walk.
	Don't slouch when you sit. Your body language says a lot about you.</li>
	<br>
	<li><mark>Expression:</mark> Don't frown. You don't have to constantly smile,
	but try to have a friendly look on your face.</li>
	<br>
	<li><mark>Attire:</mark>Dress appropriately. If you are in doubt about what to wear to a specific event,
	contact the sponsor or host and find out. Never wear wrinkled or dirty clothing.
	Take the time to polish your shoes.</li>
	<br>
	<li><mark>Makeup:</mark> Understated is always better than too much makeup.
	Start with a clean face and pick one feature to enhance.
	Most makeup experts advise clients to play up either the eyes or the lips, not both.</li>
